# Spark Churn Project
Churn Analysis Of Simulated User Data

## Introduction
We have been tasked with identifying users likely to cancel their usage of Sparkify. The data consists of simulated user data provided by Udacity, with each sample representing a record of API actions by the user. The ultimate goal is to train a model to identify user churn patterns, leveraging various big data architectures and tools, especially Apache Spark.

## The Data
The dataset is divided into two subsets: a "mini" and a "large." The "mini" dataset enables quicker code development, providing a scalable foundation for working with our extensive "large" dataset.
